  ## The source and bundle package directory structure is used when two useful
  ## functions: `devtools::load_all()` and `devtools::test()` are executed.
  ## This workaround is not needed however when you run `devtools::check()` or
  ## `R CMD check` from command line or when you use this package from a
  ## third-party code when it is already installed in the system.
  ## It is not needed in these cases because the binary package directory
  ## structure is used.
